Hello! I'm Akif, a passionate Computer Networks student with a love for Cybersecurity. I started my journey in Cybersecurity by playing CTF in December 2022. I am eager to learn more about different areas of Cybersecurity. This blog is all about my journey, writeups and notes for future references.
